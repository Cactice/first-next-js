My first time using next! I've heard it's cool.

# Opinion

I wouldn't recommend Next Js because it's css is strange and confusing.
Writing isn't too bad but using other react component with css becomes more complicated.
Also I couldn't import font. The community is still too small that to find simple solutions quickly.

That's my opinion for now.
