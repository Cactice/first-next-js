My first time using next! I've heard it's cool.

# Opinion

I wouldn't recommend Next Js because it's css is strange and confusing.<br>
Writing css isn't too bad but using other react component with css becomes more complicated (compared to create-react-app).<br>
Also I couldn't import font. The community is still too small that it's difficult to find simple solutions quickly.<br>

However the routing was simple so I would love to get back to it considering how cool this framework is supporting features like automatic code splitting.<br>


That's my opinion for now.
